Music Generator RNN

Long Short Term Memory Recursive Neural Network that generates music in the style of given musical artists.
Currently, the network is trained on MIDI files of Bach's Cello Suites, mapping pitches to characters for input to the network. 
Deals with large amounts of pre- and post- processing in order to convert MIDI files to strings of characters that could be input into the network.
